# Machine Learning Using Linear Regression

Data file : carMpg.csv

Business objective: To find estimated car mileage based on car features

Business constraints:
 1. The model should not contain more than 5 variables.
 2. According to the business needs, set the VIF to 2. 
 3. The model should be highly predictive in nature i.e it should show 80% (R squared) of accuracy.

Data understanding : This data set contains 398 observations with data of various cars. 

The features/attributes which describe the cars in the dataset are :
 1. Mpg - Numeric and continous
 2. Cylinders - Numeric and descrete
 3. Displacement - Numeric and continuous
 4. Horsepower - Numeric and continuous
 5. Weight - Numeric and continuous
 6. Acceleration - Numeric and continuous
 7. Model year - Numeric and descrete
