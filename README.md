Company Information:
An automobile consultancy firm “Mycar Dream” provides assistance to its clients in making appropriate car deals, based on their requirements.
 
Based on various market surveys, the firm has gathered a large dataset of different types of cars and their attributes across the world. The business model of the company is solely based on consumer interest, aiming to provide the most appropriate car to their clients and hence maximise the customer satisfaction.
 
Problem Statement:
Nowadays, the automobile market has become very dynamic as the buyers have varied preferences. Customers look for various features (brand value, mileage, model_year etc) in their dream car. In order to fulfil it's customer requirement, Mycar Dream wants to automate the process of predicting the car mileage which fits the customer preferences, based on the dataset of car features and attributes obtained by market surveys. 
 
The data set contains the following details about cars: 
The aim here is to predict the city-cycle fuel consumption in miles per gallon, in terms of 3 multivalued discrete and 5 continuous attributes. Below is the data dictionary to be used for the dataset.

Data file : carMpg.csv

Business objective: To find estimated car mileage based on car features

Business constraints:
 1. The model should not contain more than 5 variables.
 2. According to the business needs, set the VIF to 2. 
 3. The model should be highly predictive in nature i.e it should show 80% (R squared) of accuracy.

Data understanding : This data set contains 398 observations with data of various cars. 

The features/attributes which describe the cars in the dataset are :
 1. Mpg - Numeric and continous
 2. Cylinders - Numeric and descrete
 3. Displacement - Numeric and continuous
 4. Horsepower - Numeric and continuous
 5. Weight - Numeric and continuous
 6. Acceleration - Numeric and continuous
 7. Model year - Numeric and descrete
 8. Origin - Numeric and descrete
 9. Car name - String and descrete
